    # Address Verification consists of two main API requests: a Find request is used to narrow down a possible
    # list of addresses; and a Retrieve request is used to retrieve a fully formatted address.
    #
    # A typical address search is made up of a series of Find requests, followed by a Retrieve based on the
    # user selection. Choose a service below to find out how to use each request.
